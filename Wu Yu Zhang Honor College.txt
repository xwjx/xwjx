                                 Real Happiness
    In the first few college days, I felt a little confused with the new period in the study life. Just for being involved in social activities, a seemingly interesting activity caught my eyes.
    When I signed up for the voluntary activity in which volunteers will teach elementary school students Mathmatics, Chinese or English, I deemed it would be a cushy job. So, I made little preparations for that.
    As we guys arrived at the appointed site, a barbershop, we met the kid's mom at first. We greeted and she shouted the kid out. Then, a boy, 10 years old approximately, came out from another shop with a baby hugged with his arms, welcomed us enthusiastically with a lively smile on his face. I thought, he must be an out-going boy, so it would be an interesting teaching experience and I was sure to do a good job.
    The boy wasn't embarrassed, but showed hospitality warmly.
    But things differed completely from what I had imagined. The boy was confused with his mathematic learning at first, so I examined his mathematic assignment. To my surprise, his assignment had been accomplished without any error, but he told me he wanted more than what he learned at school. What a studious boy. So, I tried my best to impart some knowledge that are more abstract. Simultaneously, the boy was listening quite attentively, as if he was experiencing a spiritual ablution. I had never seen such an eager and devoted mind desire to harvest the nourishment for the mind, a pure boy desperately yearning for the new things, and I can feel that, he is curious about what I was speaking. As I was reporting the humdrum theories, formulas and laws on the textbook, He suddenly asked a geometrical question, a question didn't match his age. But I can comprehended his interest in math, so I didn't slack off. I didn't just tell him what it is, on the contrary, I induced him to deduce the answer logically, in order to kindle and maintain his interest. He was satisfied with the process, for his own joy, someone else can hardly understand.
    When he deduced the result he wanted, with pure delight, laughed with open-hearted enjoyment. At this moment, I comprehended what the happiness really is---find your interest and be devoted to that.
    Clouds drifted about, sun hidden with gentle breeze.
    "What' s the college life like?"
    "Well, uh, It can be colorful, or it can be mundane, it all depends on yourself because you must be responsible for yourself."
    The boy grinned, as if he had devised a discreet plan for his prospective college life, but he must be looking forward to his future life, because through his fully hopeful expression I can learned.
    "So, what do you desperately want to learn as your major in the future? "I merely explored his inner interest. I found great potential in this immature mind.
    "I love literature!" Like sunshine illuminated his mind, he excitedly spoke out.
    We discussed some topics about poetries and novels. I was amazed to find that he has distinct perspective, with profound insight towards some poems, maybe from an original child' s angel. He just expressed his opinions on the works by Bingxin, in a critical thought. He generalized the characteristics of her works in his own words, extolling the wonderful life and freshness, which refreshed my mind. He said when reading these works, he experienced relaxed, as if he was wandering in the wonderland.
    We were naturally chatting, rather than discussing some abstract feelings, and I found it relaxing to chatting with a 10-year-old boy, without any supposed gap generation. Breeze gently blew, no strong sunshine in the sky and temperature is moderate, reassuring restless mind. We exchanged ideas on real happiness, although he is still a 10-year-old boy, with immature thoughts, but still be invaluable treasure for a child' s mind, because pure children' s mind is the real poetry to depict. When we are chatting, I was suddenly evocative of a famous sentence by Bill Gates: I was so lucky to find out my hobby, and I was so fascinated, so far.
    Frankly, I confess that I had learnt a lot from him, since without this afternoon, I will not contemplate what I am chasing after, where my interest lies in.
    What' s the real happiness? Maybe, just be pure, be curious for the world, for the mystery. Maybe, happiness is just on the corner.
    May there be enough clouds in your life to make a beautiful sunset.
